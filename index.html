            <h2>The Great Pyramids of Giza</h2>
            <p>The Pyramids of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt, are among the most famous and enduring monuments of the ancient world. Built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (around 2580-2560 BCE), these massive structures have stood for over 4,500 years.</p>
            <p>The complex includes three main pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Khufu (or Cheops), the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. Along with these, the site features the Great Sphinx, several smaller queen's pyramids, and numerous mastaba tombs for nobles.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The pyramids were built as monumental tombs for the pharaohs, designed to protect their bodies and possessions for the afterlife. The ancient Egyptians believed that the pharaohs, as divine rulers, would need their earthly possessions in the next world.</p>
            <p>The Great Pyramid of Khufu is the largest and most famous, originally standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet). It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. The precision of its construction is remarkable, with the sides aligned almost perfectly with the cardinal directions.</p>
            <p>Construction of these pyramids required immense resources and labor. It's estimated that the Great Pyramid alone used about 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons. The workers were not slaves but skilled Egyptian laborers who were well-fed and housed in nearby workers' villages.</p>
